The code you shared uses the Twitter API to fetch and analyze tweets related to **Python programming**. Hereâ€™s an overview of what each part of the code does:

1. **Twitter API Setup**:
   - You authenticate using Tweepy with your API credentials (`consumer_key`, `consumer_secret`, `access_token`, and `access_token_secret`).
   - A function `fetch_tweets` is defined to fetch 100 tweets (or more) containing the query `"Python programming"`, and these tweets are stored as a list of dictionaries, which includes the tweet's full text.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - The fetched tweets are loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - A cleaning function `clean_text` is applied to remove URLs, mentions, hashtags, punctuation, and stopwords, and it converts the text to lowercase.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - The **TextBlob** library is used to perform sentiment analysis on the cleaned tweet text. Each tweet is assigned a sentiment polarity score between -1 (negative) and 1 (positive).
   
4. **Visualization**:
   - A distribution plot of sentiment scores is created using Seaborn to visualize the polarity of the fetched tweets.
   - If the tweets contain timestamps (`created_at` column), the average daily sentiment is resampled and plotted over time to see sentiment trends.

### A few points to consider:
- **Authentication**: You need to replace the placeholders (`YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY`, etc.) with your actual Twitter API credentials.
- **Timestamps**: The code assumes that you have a `'created_at'` column in the DataFrame, which is usually present in tweet data. If the data doesn't include timestamps, remove or adjust the timestamp-related code.
- **Rate Limiting**: When fetching large volumes of tweets, keep Twitter's rate limits in mind.
